Playlistr - the better way to share your favorite songs, discover new playlists, and see what your friends are vibing to.




## Overview

**Playlistr** is a web app that makes music social. Built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Spotify’s developer tools**, it lets users share songs and playlists, discover new music, and see what their friends are vibing to - all in one feed.

What started as a portfolio project to learn **React** and **Next**.js turned into something more personal. I’ve always loved sharing music and finding new sounds through friends, and I wanted to build a space made just for that.
## Features

- 🔐 Log in with Spotify (via OAuth)

- 🎵 Share songs and playlists with custom captions

- 📰 Music feed displaying posts from other users

## 🚀 About Me
I'm Justin - a software engineer based in Atlanta, GA with around 9 years of professional experience. I’ve worked across the stack, but I have a special love for clean design and building smooth user experiences.

I created Playlistr as both a passion project and a portfolio piece - a way to combine my love of music with my interest in learning new tech like React and Next.js.
